# Match 3 game

A "Match 3" game is a type of puzzle video game where the player manipulates tiles in order to make them disappear according to a matching criterion. In many match-3 games, that criterion is to place a given number of tiles of the same type so that they adjoin each other. Typically, the tiles are in a grid, and the player can control or swap adjacent tiles.

The objective of these games is to swap one tile with an adjacent one to form a chain of three or more tiles of the same type. Once matched, the tiles disappear or change the board in some way. The player may be tasked with achieving certain goals in a specific amount of moves or time, or they may just be free to play until they run out of possible moves.

Popular examples of match-3 games include "Bejeweled", "Candy Crush Saga", and "Farm Heroes Saga". These games are often free to play, with in-app purchases available to enhance gameplay or speed up progress. They can be very addictive, as they typically feature simple mechanics but offer increasingly challenging puzzles.
