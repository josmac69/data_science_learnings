# Hidden object game

A "hidden object game" (also known as a "hidden picture" game) is a genre of puzzle video game in which the player must find items from a list that are hidden within a picture or scene.

Hidden object games are a popular trend in casual gaming, and are comparatively inexpensive to buy. Time-limited trial versions of these games are usually available for download.

In hidden object games, the player is presented with a scene, typically cluttered with many items that are irrelevant to the task at hand. Somewhere in this scene, certain items are hidden—camouflaged or obscured in some way—and the player's goal is to find and click on these items.

Here are a few examples of popular hidden object games:

1. **Mystery Case Files series**: This is one of the most popular hidden object game series. Each game is a mix of hidden object puzzles and other types of puzzle mini-games.

2. **June's Journey**: This is a hidden object game developed by Wooga where you solve mind-teasing mysteries in the glamorous 1920s. You dive into June Parker's captivating quest to unveil a scandalous family secret.

3. **Pearl's Peril**: Another game by Wooga, this hidden object adventure game is set in the golden age of mystery and adventure. You play as Pearl Wallace, a brave pilot and world explorer, as you uncover a conspiracy involving her father's suicide.

5. **Criminal Case**: This is a detective-themed hidden object game where you solve murder cases by finding the relevant clues in crime scenes.

These games can be quite addictive, as they require focus, quick observation skills, and they often include engaging storylines to keep the player interested.
