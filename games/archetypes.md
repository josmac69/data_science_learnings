# Archetypes in games

Carl Gustav Jung's archetypes and Joseph Campbell's concept of the "Hero's Journey" have been influential in many areas, including the design and storytelling of video games. Here's how they can be applied:

1. **Jung's Archetypes**: Jung proposed that myths and stories across cultures contain common characters and themes, which he called archetypes. These include the Hero, the Shadow (or villain), the Anima/Animus (the feminine side of a man/the masculine side of a woman), the Mentor, and many others. These archetypes can be used to create characters in video games that players instinctively understand and connect with.

   For example, the Mentor archetype is often used in games to guide the player character. In "The Legend of Zelda" series, the character of Navi serves as a mentor to the hero, Link. Similarly, the Shadow archetype can be used to create compelling villains that represent the darker aspects of the hero.

2. **Campbell's Hero's Journey**: Joseph Campbell's monomyth, or the Hero's Journey, is a narrative pattern that involves a hero who goes on an adventure, faces and overcomes a crisis, and then comes home transformed. This structure can be used to create engaging and satisfying game narratives.

   For instance, many role-playing games (RPGs) follow the Hero's Journey. The player character starts as an ordinary person, receives a call to adventure (like discovering they are the chosen one), goes on a quest, faces trials, receives aid from allies, confronts and defeats a major adversary, and returns home with a reward (like saving the world).

   A classic example of the Hero's Journey in video games is the "Final Fantasy" series. In "Final Fantasy VII", the protagonist Cloud Strife starts as a mercenary, faces numerous trials, loses and gains allies, confronts his nemesis Sephiroth, and finally saves the world.

Using Jung's archetypes and Campbell's Hero's Journey can help game developers create characters and stories that resonate with players on a deep, subconscious level. These tools tap into universal patterns and structures, making the game's narrative feel familiar and engaging, regardless of the player's personal background or culture.

## Data driven analysis of archetypes in games

Data science can be combined with archetypal myths and psychological findings to create data-driven storytelling. This approach can be particularly effective in fields like marketing, user experience design, and game development. Here are a few examples:

1. **Personalized User Experiences**: By analyzing user data, companies can identify which Jungian archetypes their customers most closely align with. They can then tailor their messaging and user experiences to resonate with those archetypes. For example, a fitness app might identify that many of its users fit the "Hero" archetype, and could then use a Hero's Journey narrative in its user experience, presenting workouts as "battles" and fitness goals as "quests."

2. **Marketing and Advertising**: Advertisers can use data science to segment their audience based on psychological traits and then use archetypal storytelling to create ads that will resonate with each segment. For instance, a car company might find that customers who buy their sports cars often exhibit traits associated with the "Explorer" archetype, and could create ads that depict the car as a tool for exciting adventures.

3. **Game Development**: Game developers can use player data to understand which archetypes and narratives players find most engaging, and then use those insights to shape the game's story and character development. For example, if data shows that players are most engaged when the game's narrative follows a Hero's Journey structure, the developers might decide to structure future games, or updates to the game, around that narrative pattern.

4. **Content Recommendation Systems**: Streaming platforms like Netflix or Spotify could analyze user behavior to identify preferences for certain archetypes or narrative structures, and then recommend content that features those elements. For example, if a user frequently watches movies that feature the "Mentor" archetype (like Obi-Wan Kenobi in "Star Wars"), the platform might recommend other movies with prominent Mentor characters.

5. **Social Media Analysis**: By analyzing social media data, researchers can identify archetypal narratives in the way people present themselves online. This could provide insights into how different archetypes resonate with different audiences, which could be valuable for everything from brand positioning to political campaigns.

In all these examples, the key is combining data analysis with an understanding of archetypal myths and psychology. By doing so, you can uncover patterns and insights that might not be apparent from the data alone, and use those insights to tell stories that resonate with your audience on a deep, psychological level.
