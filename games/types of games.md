"Match 3" and "Hidden Object" games are sub-genres that typically fall under the broader category of Puzzle Games or Casual Games. Here's a bit more detail on each:

1. **Match 3 Games**: These games involve swapping adjacent items to form a line or group of at least three of the same kind. The matched items are then removed, and new items drop into the game board. The player typically has to reach a certain score or complete specific objectives within a given number of moves or time limit. Examples of Match 3 games include "Bejeweled", "Candy Crush Saga", and "Gems of War". These games are often categorized as Puzzle Games due to their problem-solving nature, and Casual Games due to their simple mechanics and short, self-contained play sessions.

2. **Hidden Object Games**: In these games, the player is presented with a scene filled with many items, and they have to find specific items from a list. These games often include other puzzle elements, such as mini-games or riddles, and they typically feature a narrative or storyline. Examples of Hidden Object games include "Mystery Case Files", "Hidden City", and "June's Journey". Like Match 3 games, Hidden Object games are often categorized as Puzzle Games due to their focus on problem-solving, and Casual Games due to their accessibility and the self-contained nature of their play sessions.

Both Match 3 and Hidden Object games are popular among a wide range of players, including those who may not typically play video games, due to their simple controls, easy-to-understand mechanics, and the satisfaction that comes from solving puzzles. They can be played in short bursts or for extended periods, making them ideal for both quick breaks and longer play sessions.
