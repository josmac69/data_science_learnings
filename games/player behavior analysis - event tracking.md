# Player Behavior Analysis - Event Tracking

Event tracking is a method used in data analytics to measure and analyze specific interactions or events that occur while a user is playing a game. In the context of a mobile gaming company, this could include a wide variety of in-game events such as:

1. **Level Completion**: Tracking when a player completes a level can provide insights into the difficulty and length of your levels. If many players are completing levels quickly, they might be too easy. If players are getting stuck on certain levels, they might be too hard.

2. **Achievements**: If your game has a system of achievements or milestones, tracking when players earn these can help you understand what players are doing in your game and what they find rewarding.

3. **In-App Purchases**: Tracking when and what players purchase can help you understand what players find valuable. This can inform decisions about what types of items or features to develop and how to price them.

4. **Game Saves**: Tracking when players save their game can give you insights into player engagement and how long players tend to play in a single session.

5. **Character Selection**: If your game allows players to choose or customize characters, tracking these choices can give you insights into player preferences.

6. **Interactions with Non-Player Characters (NPCs)**: If your game involves interactions with NPCs, tracking these can help you understand which characters players are most interested in and how they are engaging with the story.

7. **Use of Game Features**: If your game has special features or mechanics (like a crafting system, a magic system, etc.), tracking usage of these features can help you understand what aspects of gameplay players find most engaging.

8. **Errors or Crashes**: Tracking when your game crashes or when players encounter errors can help you identify and fix technical issues.

By tracking these events, you can gather a wealth of data about how players are interacting with your game. This data can then be analyzed to gain insights into player behavior and preferences, which can inform decisions about game design, marketing, monetization, and more.
