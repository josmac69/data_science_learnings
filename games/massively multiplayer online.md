# MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online)

Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games are a type of video game that are capable of supporting hundreds or thousands of players simultaneously. They are played on the internet, allowing players from all around the world to interact with each other within a virtual world.

In MMO games, each player controls a specific character, often called an avatar, within a persistently online world. This means that the game's world continues to exist and evolve even when players are offline. Players can interact with each other in a variety of ways, such as by chatting, trading, forming alliances, or competing against each other.

MMO games often feature large, open-world environments that players can explore. They typically involve some form of progression system, where players can improve their characters by completing tasks, defeating enemies, or gaining experience points. This often involves a leveling system, where characters become more powerful as they gain levels.

There are several sub-genres within the MMO genre, including:

1. **MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game):** These games, like "World of Warcraft" or "Final Fantasy XIV", combine the large-scale multiplayer aspect of MMOs with the character progression and narrative elements of role-playing games (RPGs).

2. **MMOFPS (Massively Multiplayer Online First-Person Shooter):** These games, like "PlanetSide 2", combine the multiplayer aspect of MMOs with the action and shooting mechanics of first-person shooters (FPS).

3. **MMORTS (Massively Multiplayer Online Real-Time Strategy):** These games, like "Clash of Clans", combine the multiplayer aspect of MMOs with the strategic gameplay of real-time strategy (RTS) games.

The appeal of MMO games lies in their social aspect and the ability to explore and inhabit another world with other players. They often require cooperation between players, such as forming groups or guilds to tackle challenging content, which can lead to a strong sense of community.
